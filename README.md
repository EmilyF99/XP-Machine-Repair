# XP-Machine-Repair
This is a retro-active report as the project was completed a long time ago, therefore images are not accurate of the work undertaken at the time and images of some steps are not included.

I bought this Dell Optiplex at a Carboot around 2018. This was the year I started University and I did not take this project with my to University so it only got completed in 2020.
This machines purpose was to be a Windows XP machine for me to play XP era video games. The reason for this is because newer Operating Systems can have issues running older software.
While I am aware of virtual machines nothing is quite like having the real thing. 

When I test booted this machine I recieved an error regarding the internal clock as well as an overheating issue. I also noted that the machine booted into Ubuntu and the old users data was protected. 
Now I knew the machine booted I took all the components out completely and cleaned the machine thoroughly as this machine was very dusty inside. While all the components were out of the case I inspected them all for quality as well as replacing the original thermal paste. 

I was inspecting for additional dirt build up I may have missed, signs of force damage, smell of burnout and general degrading (such as expanding capacitors). I found that the graphics card was damaged at some point.
The bottom corner of the heatsink looked like it had been pulled off and restuck with something similar to white tac. I removed this component and replaced it as I didn't trust it and suspected that could have caused overheating issues.

I replaced the BIOS battery in this machine, this was the source of the clock error and once replaced this error was removed. 

I then wiped the harddrive and reinstalled Windows XP onto the drive. I decided to keep the original drive as it outwardly appears to be of good health and I don't plan on storing anything important on this machine so I don't mind the data loss risk.

I replaced the graphics card with a GTX 710 1GB as this seemed like a low form factor card that would be similar to the card I removed. I decided to replace it with a brand new card as I didn't want to risk buying a fried card at the time as I had no cards spare. 

I then upgraded the RAM in this machine by buying some old stock RAM. However this line of Optiplexs can be funny about RAM upgrades and for some reason this machine would only accept three sticks of the RAM. I rotated the sticks out to see if one of the sticks was damaged but could not find a fault with any of the sticks. Nor was there a fault with the socket as the original RAM the machine came with worked in all the slots.
When trying to use all the sticks of RAM the machine refused to boot and would display a light pattern on the power button. When comparing to the original manual you can use these light flashes to diagnose the problem with your machine. 
I'm not sure why all the RAM would not work in this machine however I did come across some old forum posts detailing other issues people had in the past regarding this machine and RAM speeds as well as specific RAM brands not working.

After the RAM upgrade I was happy with this machine and use it frequently when I feel like playing some XP era PC Games.
